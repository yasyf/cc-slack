## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- Attachments in folders macOS protects from the daemon, such as `~/Documents`, post again. The CLI and channel server hand the daemon temporary copies, where before the daemon's open blocked until the request timed out.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- The Homebrew cask strips the quarantine flag from the binary before its first run.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- When a subagent stops while it still owns active watches, the top-level session gets a `slack.owner_stopped` event and a directive listing those watches and how to resume or retire them.
- Each release tag now carries its own binrun descriptor, so installing the plugin at tag N runs cc-slack N.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-22

### Fixed
- The tagged plugin now carries its binrun descriptor, so installing the plugin at a release tag provisions the binary.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added
- The cc-slack daemon, CLI, and channel server, with the Claude Code plugin and its marketplace.
- A TOML config for credentials (SSM or environment), badged avatars, doc-card previews, and the permission hook name.
- PROTOCOL.md, the backend wire contract, with fixtures the daemon's types are tested against.
